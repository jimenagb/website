Although I value lectures, my favorite active learning teaching methods include experiential learning, inquiry or problem-based activities. My goal is to spark curiosity about biology through concrete experiences, real world examples and evaluating issues in conservation from different perspectives 

One way I instill curiosity in my students is through an activity on biodiversity for the General Ecology course at University of Wyoming. Students practiced biodiversity metrics on their taxonomic group and location of choice using iNaturalist, a popular citizen science platform and growing online database. Since I am an active user of iNaturalist (over ~3,000 observations), I am able to share my passion for engagement in the scientific process beyond academic settings. Similarly, I love presenting students with other innovative sofware such as Nextstrain.org, asking them to describe how a pathogen of their choice travelled around the world. I keep my self up-to-date in technological advances and constantly seek opportunities to present both inquiry-based content in multiple ways, fostering curiosity and learning. 

The process of learning is inherently multifaceted; thus, I believe that integrating content and assessment tools in various forms can be beneficial for student learning. For instance, I use individual and team-based quizzes, to encourage collaboration and helping of others. Integrating the interests of students is another way to cultivate a learning drive and self-confidence that can promote peer-learning. Class projects in which students take concepts learned in class and apply it to solve a puzzle or societal problem of their choice is a powerful way to transfer knowledge that directly matches societal needs (McInerney et al. 2011, Delić and Bećirović 2016). One way I have implemented such an experiential learning framework (as described in Walker and Rocconi 2022) is through an environmental DNA (eDNA) lab in a Genetics course [recently published here](https://ctl.acaweb.org/digging-deeper/environmental-dna-in-the-classroom-a-case-study/). In this activity students learned the steps of a scientific project starting with a concrete experience in wildlife conservation involving the detection of a local aquatic species of conservation concern, listening to local conservation practitioners, developing, and implementing a monitoring protocol, reflecting on their understanding of a tool in molecular genetics, and suggesting new ideas for future projects.

In addition to incorporating customized content, instilling curiosity and critical thinking, I also believe in integrating relevant and diverse examples into teaching, so that students can witness more of the diverse and intercultural community currently involved in the process of discovery, science, and technology (Landreman 2013; Tanner 2013). I deeply value the opportunity to be constantly growing professionally, discussing scientific ideas, and celebrating diversity through my teaching. Just as previous researchers encouraged me to pursue science, I pursue opportunities to inspire and help others to do so.

### Outreach
Along with my research interests, I strive to be an engaging science communicator activities involving both adult and children audiences.

Recently, Alessandra Baltodano from [Wimblu](https://wimblu.com/en/) invited me to be a guest in their magazine's podcast for an episode about "Inseparable lineages" where we discussed the unity of all forms of life ([available here](https://wimblu.com/en/volumen-5/linajes-inseparables/)). Every so often, I make short videos that I share through a youtube channel, if interested check this one I made of [Lake Tanganyika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekSZXCzmmfc). I also post nature photography in my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/golcherbenavides/?hl=en) account.

Please contact me if you are interested in a guest lecture or outreach activity on biodiversity, freshwater fish conservation, or to chat about cool fish. 

If you would like classroom material about fish, check [this worksheet](./Fish_Underwater_4thGrade_28jan2021.pdf) I prepared to introduced 4th grade students to fish biology.
