# Jimena's new academic website in progress
I include here all the materials needed to follow the R Markdown website template tutorial for a lab journal developed by
Dr. Matt Crump [https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html). I have cloned these files here as I prepare to re-launch my github website.
